        Step 1. Determine, ranging from 1 to 5, a values for the attributes: Strength, Dexterity, Charisma, Wits.
        Step 2. Determine a value, ranging from 6 to 12, for their maximum hitpoints.
        Step 3. Determine a value, ranging from 1 to 5, for their Arete, which is their magical proficiency.
        Step 4. Based on the character concept and on the values that were determined for the character level, attributes and arete, provide a highly detailed description of the character's appearance. Use at least 20 and at most 40 words.
        Step 5. Based on the character concept and on the values that were determined for the character level, attributes and arete, provide a highly detailed description of the character's personality. Use at least 20 and at most 40 words.
        Step 6. Based on the character concept and on the values that were determined for the character level, attributes and arete, provide a highly detailed description of the character's abilities. Use at least 20 and at most 40 words.
        Step 7. Based on the character concept, on the starting location description, on the values that were determined in Steps 0 to 3, and on the descriptions that were provided in Steps 4, 5 and 6, write a highly detailed backstory for them. Use at least 100 and at most 200 words.
        Step 8. Based on the character concept, on the starting location description, on the values that were determined in Steps 0 to 3, on the descriptions that were provided in Steps 4, 5 and 6, and on the backstory written at Step 7, determine a list of at least 3 facts that the character consider to be the most relevant to keep in memory. Describe each fact in at most 10 words.
        Step 9. Based on the character concept, on the starting location description, on the values that were determined in Steps 0 to 3, on the descriptions that were provided in Steps 4, 5 and 6, on the backstory written at Step 7, and on the list of facts determined in Step 8, determine a list of three goals the character has, one for the next minutes, one for the next hours, one for the next weeks. Describe each goal in at most 10 words. Use the format `<timeframe of the goal>{tcol}<goal description>`, where `timeframe of the goal` is one of: minute, hour, week.
        Step 10. Based on the character concept, on the starting location description, on the values that were determined in Steps 0 to 3, on the descriptions that were provided in Steps 4, 5 and 6, on the backstory written at Step 7, on the list of facts determined in Step 8, and on the list of goals determined at Step 9, determine a list of three plans the character is making to achieve each of their goals. Describe each plan in at most 10 words. Use the format `<timeframe of the goal>{tcol}<plan corresponding to the goal>`, where `timeframe of the goal` is one of: minute, hour, week.

Based on the character concept, on the values that were determined in Steps 0 to 3, on the descriptions that were provided in Steps 4, 5 and 6, on the backstory written at Step 7, on the list of facts determined in Step 8, and on the list of goals determined at Step 9, determine a list of the equipments the character possess. Describe each equipment using the format: `name of the equipment: <description>`.
        Step 12. Based on the character concept and on the backstory written at Step 7, determine a value between 2 and 100, corresponding to how much gold do they possess.
        Step 13. Considering the range of coordinates provided in "starting_location_coordinates", determine a coordinate in the format (x, y) for the character's position, within the range given.
        Step 14. Considering the description of the starting location, the current position of the character, determined at Step 13, their Wits, abilities and equipments, provide a description of their perceived surroundings. Use at least 20 and at most 40 words.
