With a friendly smile, Maskaz introduces himself and explains that he is a new fighter who wants to learn from the best. The man nods and agrees to share some insights, explaining that the key to victory is not only physical strength and skill, but also mental preparation and strategy. He advises Maskaz to observe his opponents closely and look for weaknesses that he can exploit, to keep his cool even in the face of danger, and to use his brains as much as his brawn.
